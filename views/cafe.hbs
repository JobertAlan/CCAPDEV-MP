                A good mix of Filipino food and a variety of italian/american food. Their baby back ribs is not that soft compare to other places I’ve been to Manila. 
                The kare kare is good but also not as tender. The spaghetti is really good since my son really enjoyed it. Their flourless chocolate is divine, 
                and the mango cheesecake is just ok for my taste. I would recommend this for tourists who wants to enjoy a Filipino delicacy and also have a taste of their
                 favorite italian/american food. By the way, the espresso is awesome, can’t beat that compare to starbucks.
